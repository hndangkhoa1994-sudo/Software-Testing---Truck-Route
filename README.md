🧩 Project Overview

This project simulates a delivery management system for a local logistics company operating three trucks on separate routes within a 25×25 grid map.
Each truck must deliver packages to buildings (black blocks) and navigate around obstacles to find the shortest valid path using the A* pathfinding algorithm.

🎯 Objectives

Develop and test an algorithm to assign packages to the most suitable truck based on:

Weight (≤ 1200 kg)

Volume (≤ 50 m³)

Route proximity (minimum diversion distance)

Design and execute a complete software testing cycle, including:

Unit, integration, and acceptance testing

Black-box and white-box testing strategies

Automated pre-push test hooks in Git

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Design, build, and test a solution for a realistic logistics problem

Apply structured testing methodologies and traceability matrices

Collaborate via Agile Scrum, GitHub, and Jira

Automate quality control to ensure bug-free commits

⚙️ Technical Implementation

Language: C / C++ (using Visual Studio Test Framework)

Algorithm: A* shortest path for truck routing

Version Control: GitHub (private repository with hooks)

Project Management: Jira Kanban board & weekly Scrum reports

Testing:

Unit tests (black box & white box)

Integration tests (bottom-up approach)

Acceptance tests (Alpha & Beta phases)

Automated pre-push test validation
